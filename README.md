# Advaced Protocol
Official Python implementation of the Avdaced protocol.

## What is Advaced?
Advaced is a decantralized blockchain protocol, which uses the cryptocurrency Vace (VAC for short). Advaced makes use of the delegated PoS consensus mechanism. Our future goal is to add smart contracts and the system of a Beacon Chain and its Shard Chains.
