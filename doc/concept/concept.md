# Concept
This is the concept of the Advaced protocol or the shortcut VAC.
It is based on the [bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and the [proof-of-stake (PoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) protocol.

## Structure
The concept is based on these 5 parts:

- [Blockchain](./blockchain.md)
- [Transactions](./transactions.md)
- [Privacy](./privacy.md)
- [Network](./network.md)
- [Proof-of-stake (PoS)](./proof-of-stake.md)

## Abstract
Advaced is an electronic cash-system as a decentralized chain based on digital signatures and a validation process.
Every block in the chain is created and validated by the nodes in the network. 
The validator is (pseudo) randomly selected by the network and validates the block with the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. 
A validator needs at least 64 staked VAC to become one.
To create an incentive every time a block is created the validator receives a reward for it.

No trusted third party is needed to make a transaction.
It is good for the environmental as it does not need as much energy and hardware to run it as in the proof-of-work consensus (wich is for example used by bitcoin).
