# Network
The network consists of nodes. 
Each node collects new transactions into a block and broadcasts them to all the other nodes. 
As a block is completely full (one block can store 1,024 transactions) or the time to collect transactions is over (64 seconds after the last block was created) a block is created by a (pseudo) random validator [5] (a node in the network that has staked coins).
