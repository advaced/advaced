# Proof-of-stake (PoS)
Proof of stake is a type of [consensus mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) used by decentralized networks to achieve distributed consensus.
Unlike [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) a miner is not in need of verifying a block with energy and hardware ressources, but to verify it with a stake of VAC. 

## Staking and its Incentive
As miners in proof-of-work validators are responsible for the creation of new blocks and the ordering of transactions so that every node in the network can agree on the current state of it.
A minimum of 64 Advaced is required to become a validator.
A validator is (pseudo) randomly selected by the network.
To create an incentive to become a validator, every time a block is validated the validator becomes a reward.
Every 1,024,000 blocks this reward is halfed.

## Vulnerabilities
If someone wants to attack the network he must own 51% of the network to do it. 
This is not only a big amount of VAC the attacker must afford, but it is also very risky for him as if the network makes sense of it and knows that he wants to attack it he loses his whole stake and this would be a big amount of coins. 
Even if the attacker could afford it and the network would not notice it until he owns 51% of the network, the worth of the currency drops and his effort would be worthless.

## Benefits
Positive aspects of proof-of-stake:
- It is Environmentally friendlier than the currently common used proof-of-work consens mechanism, because it does not need as much energy and hardware.
- It is easier to become a node, because there is no need of good hardware.
- Also there is not as much danger to become centralized for the reason that this system should lead to more nodes in the network.
- The spectrum of vulnerabilities is not as large as in other consens mechanisms. Only the 51% attack could become a problem, but the probability for such an event is very low.

## Staking pools
If an individual can't afford as much coins as needed to become a validator he could easily join a staking pool, where many individual stake their coins together to afford a stake.
